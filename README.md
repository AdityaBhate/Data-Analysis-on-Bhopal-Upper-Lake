# Bhopal Upper Lake Data Analysis

This project focuses on collecting satellite data of Bhopal's Upper Lake and performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The objective of the project was to gain insights into the lake's characteristics and study any observable patterns or trends.

## Project Details

- The data collection phase involved utilizing a Python script to gather satellite data of Bhopal's Upper Lake.

- Data cleaning techniques were applied to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the collected data. This step involved handling missing values, addressing outliers, and resolving any inconsistencies in the dataset.

- The EDA phase utilized popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Various statistical analyses and visualizations were performed to gain insights into the lake's properties and identify patterns or trends within the dataset.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the collected satellite data and any additional datasets used for analysis.
- `data collection/`: This directory contains the Python script used for data collection.
- `UpperLake.ipynb`: Notebook containing the EDA
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and its components.
